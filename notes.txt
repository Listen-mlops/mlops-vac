- Airflow is the platform where you can process data from multiple data sources like RDBMS , NoSQL as of the machine 
  learning models do not allow multiple data sources to be accessed at one time so we require this platform.
- Apache Airflow is used for the scheduling and orchestration of data pipelines or workflows. Orchestration of data 
  pipelines refers to the sequencing, coordination, scheduling, and managing of complex data pipelines from diverse 
  sources.

*** DEPRECATION WARNING ***

Cookiecutter data science is moving to v2 soon, which will entail using
the command `ccds ...` rather than `cookiecutter ...`. The cookiecutter command
will continue to work, and this version of the template will still be available.
To use the legacy template, you will need to explicitly use `-c v1` to select it.

Please update any scripts/automation you have to append the `-c v1` option,
which is available now.

For example:
    cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science
